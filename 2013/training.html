<p>The day starts at 0600, and by 0735, I will have walked 600m to the nearest train station to catch a sprinter. I reach office by 0815, down a hot cup of coffee in the lounge, and climb up to <em>Joseph Fourier</em> room. Lectures begin at 0830. Lunch at 1300. Then, around 1500 the group work begins. </p>
<p>I am on a two week intensive training, and it&rsquo;s killing me. My toes go numb wearing shoes for over twelve straight hours. By the time I head back, it is nearly 2000, and much of The Hague is closed shut. By the time I pick up my pasta at <em>Julia&rsquo;s</em>, I am dead tired. I come to my room, have that supper and crash. To top it, the weather has been just wonderful: temperatures between 2&ndash;6&deg;C, with the occasional drizzle. On the plus side, I feel my calf muscles are getting healthier from all that walking. </p>
<p>Another week to go before this hamster jumps from a wheel in the lab to one in the field.</p>
