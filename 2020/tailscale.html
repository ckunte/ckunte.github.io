<p>I never thought I&rsquo;d say this to describe a networking tool + service, but <a href="https://tailscale.com/" title="Tailscale">Tailscale</a> is deliverance to internet&rsquo;s inertia problem I&rsquo;ve been waiting for.</p>
<p>Kicking tyres, it took just five minutes to (a) sign-up and install Tailscale on two nodes (a very old iMac, and a very old MacBook Air), (b) connect one to my home network, and other to a cellular network, and (c) open a connection between the two. The experience is like you&rsquo;re already there. Amazing! Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/" title="How Tailscale works">how it works</a>.</p>
<p>In 2010, Avery Pennarun <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201005" title="201005 - apenwarr">created sshuttle</a>, which could open a tunnel between my laptop and my then $2/mo web host (with no admin access) with just this command: </p>
<pre><code>$ ./sshuttle -r &lt;username&gt;@&lt;webhost&gt; 0.0.0.0/0 -v
</code></pre>
<p>Running this in a Terminal, I could access internet on my laptop at web host&rsquo;s IP address &mdash; be it via browser, email, chat, terminal, or any app. In other words, with sshuttle I could re-purpose a cheap web host as my VPN! </p>
<p>Like I said, I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sshuttle/1-sZogGfAHM/yNNmMO0yR2kJ">experienced this magic</a> before, but Tailscale is an order of magnitude better, faster, and safer with <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" title="WireGuard: fast, modern, secure VPN tunnel">WireGuard</a> as its data plane. Tailscale also happens to be an offering by Avery and team. These good engineers have been thinking about enabling a poor man&rsquo;s VPN for a decade, and are now working to get back the internet we&rsquo;ve all wanted &mdash; access our home computer(s) from the road without the complexity or the horrors of security that come along with it.</p>
