<p>Dr. Joshua Lederberg:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The single biggest threat to man&rsquo;s continued dominance on the planet is the virus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deadly <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" title="Coronavirus disease 2019">Coronavirus pandemic disease</a> is upon us, propagating at an unprecedented scale. Global health is in full-crisis mode with self-quarantine directives, extensive mass-scale screenings, weekly health clock-ins, and border closures. Leaders of the world are giving us their <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/angela-merkel-nails-coronavirus-speech-unlike-trump.html" title="Watch Angela Merkel’s Coronavirus Speech - English Subtitles">solemn advice</a> to adhere strictly to practice physical distancing, which is the <em>only</em> form of prevention, since there is no cure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/23-03-2020-pass-the-message-five-steps-to-kicking-out-coronavirus" title="Pass the message: Five steps to kicking out coronavirus">WHO&rsquo;s guidance</a> to combat the virus that each individual can practice is in five steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Focused hand washing</li>
<li>Coughing etiquette</li>
<li>Not touching your face</li>
<li>Physical distancing</li>
<li>Staying home if feeling unwell</li>
</ol>
<p>We&rsquo;re worried about family and loved ones afar. It&rsquo;s week one for us since the advisory to work from home went out. Schools are still open, but not compulsory. Universities are exploring lectures online.</p>
<p>Modern technology is a blessing. The ability reach out to hear and see your loved one(s) stuck in another continent cannot be overstated. Without FaceTime, our hearts would be in our mouths everyday, feeling gutted and helpless. Instead, huddling over the screen we played a few quiz games using <a href="https://kahoot.com/" title="Kahoot!">kahoot</a> today.</p>
<p>Kids&rsquo; schools and universities are looking to move curricula online. This is a new frontier. Now that studying from home is fast becoming a reality, I&rsquo;ve been asking my kids time and again if they need an external display. They keep saying no.</p>
<p>In this age of interconnectivity, it appears people are unfortunately armed with far more tools than wit or the wisdom to assess the information they receive, and determine if it is worth sharing. It&rsquo;s either that or it&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" title="Dunning–Kruger effect - Wikipedia">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>. Social media is already rife with things like the false news of the availability of vaccine for the novel Coronavirus pandemic disease, incorrect advice on protective measures, alternative medicine options luring people into a false sense of safety, etc. </p>
<p>Attribution and source are two important things that people tend to forget, and therefore it&rsquo;s important to gently remind the enthusiasts amongst us to check first. Exercise your duty of care, and be the kitchen sink to incorrect or downright falsehood that beckons you to forward it along.</p>
