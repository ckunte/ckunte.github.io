<p>Third day of our visit to China was the day I was looking forward to &mdash; to scale a tiny section of the formidable great wall. The original itinerary included the Badaling, and we did rush there beating Beijing&rsquo;s chaotic morning traffic and smog. But snowfall and traffic forced us to go see the wall near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juyong_Pass">Juyong pass</a> instead, the one that was used by Mongolian invaders, time and again, to breach the middle kingdom, which eventually forced the Chinese emperor to build one there to stop recurring attacks.</p>

<p>The single <a href="http://www.kuriositas.com/2012/07/the-great-wall-of-china-diverse.html">most fascinating</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/philwalker79/6247054068/">reason</a> to revisit China, if I would ever, would be to scale the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2012/10/the-great-wall-of-china/100383/">Great Wall</a> again. With as ancient as 2,200 years old, and over 21,000km long, the kind of exhilaration one feels being on that wall, as I jogged a section of the strategic Juyong pass early this month, is hard to adequately to express in words. In Ian Johnston&rsquo;s translation, Franz Kafka&rsquo;s essay on <a href="http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/kafka/greatwallofchina.htm">The Great Wall of China</a> (published by Max Brod fourteen years after Kafka&rsquo;s death) notes thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hopelessness of such a hard task, which could not be completed even in a long human lifetime, would have caused them distress and, more than anything else, made them worthless for work. For that reason the system of building in sections was chosen. Five hundred meters could be completed in something like five years, by which time naturally the supervisors were, as a rule, too exhausted and had lost all faith in themselves, in the building, and in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Xi&rsquo;an</strong>. It was dark by the time we descended on Xi&rsquo;an. Like any other airport in China, Xi&rsquo;an&rsquo;s airport is somewhere between large and staggering, and still expanding. It isn&rsquo;t hard to hazard a guess why. Xi&rsquo;an (or Chang&rsquo;an, as it was known in the past) is one of those few cities in the world to transcend time in retaining their gateway status, with its claim to fame and prosperity being one to the ancient, legendary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road">Silk Road</a>. </p>
<p>As the trade artery between the East and the West, historians have also linked it to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> period, followed by an era of breakthrough philosophy, science and mathematics in the 3rd century B.C. If one steps back to look at the entire scene, one can see that this was an era that had everything, together with danger and adventure thrown in the mix; and it all travelled back and forth from Xi&rsquo;an all the way to Rome and possibly <a href="/2011/agora">Alexandria</a>. </p>
<p>Next morning, we headed out to see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta_Army">Terracotta Army</a>.</p>
<p>Like the Egyptian Pharaohs, it is apparent that Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, believed in the afterlife, and so he began a construction of an army to protect him in his afterlife soon after he ascended throne in his teens. Becoming obsessed with death later in life, he actively sought immortality presumably using methods by those who preached it. I mean we have to come to terms with the fact that some of the greatest art in the world is attributed to insanity of individuals with great power.</p>

<p>As a substitute of burying a real army, bless the person who advised this to the emperor, a life size army made out of terracotta was approved and was built to perfection. That every detail, feature, position or posture is unique for each of those is stunning. And it is in these masterpieces &mdash; everyone of them &mdash; is where we have a glimpse of life, attires, shoes they wore (all with perfect soles and treads), their weaponry, and their horses.</p>
<p>The bow-trigger is just one of those details that offer a glimpse of sophistication in their weaponry, i.e., they apparently used crossbows with bronze triggers. The wood obviously rotted long ago, leaving only the metallic parts like the one above behind as evidence, which is still a remarkable discovery in knowing they understood the mechanics of a trigger to be able to develop one that would be efficient as a weapon, and issued to warriors in the emperor&rsquo;s army. That this entire army was discovered as late as 1974 makes it even more remarkable; the world is just fortunate that it wasn&rsquo;t discovered by the Luddites of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we went up to see the city wall. It&rsquo;s part of the fortification, appropriate for a city such as Xi&rsquo;an&rsquo;s stature as either the beginning or end of Silk Road, that still survives for us to walk on.</p>
<p>Next morning, we paid a visit to the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda, established by Xuanxang, the second Chinese traveller to India after Faxian, in the 7th century in search of India&rsquo;s culture, knowledge, philosophy, and spirituality. Xuanxang is known to have studied in the ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nalanda">Nalanda University</a> for about eight to fifteen years, and he brought back to China the sutras and figurines of the Buddha that enrich the pagoda today.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of the Silk Road, with its access to Eurasia and Persia via Yarkand, Badakhshan and Bactria, Xi&rsquo;an has a large middle-eastern influence, and it is nowhere more obvious than in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Mosque_of_Xi'an">The Great Mosque</a>, which was likely built in the 8th century. We spent a pleasant afternoon there. And in the evening, we took a flight to Guilin.</p>
