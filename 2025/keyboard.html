<p>My oft-used at home is a <a href="https://caniusevia.com/">VIA</a> enabled, mechanical keyboard featuring 60-key hot-swappable, low-profile wisteria switches. I like the form factor, and it&rsquo;s definitely an upgrade from my previous 49-key with full-sized switches.</p>
<p>The problem with mechanical keyboards in these sizes is that they have odd layouts, and they  omit some important keys. My biggest gripe is that the <kbd>Fn</kbd> key is often located inconveniently on the right hand side (instead of being on the left hand side), and further it&rsquo;s pre-mapped (i.e. locked) to back lighting and other such cosmetic nonsense I have no interest in.</p>
<p>At the time of purchase, I did not realise how much of a handicap such layouts pose. For instance, mine has no function key row &mdash; not an issue per se, but has no navigation keys either (viz., <kbd>Home</kbd>, <kbd>PgDn</kbd>, <kbd>PgUp</kbd>, <kbd>End</kbd>). This is a solved problem in the membrane-types, in which there is a <kbd>Fn</kbd> key on the left hand side, which can be combined with arrow keys to get this functionality.</p>
<p>While I could map <kbd>Cmd</kbd> and arrow keys to get me the above functionality, it conflicts with Raspberry Pi OS&rsquo;s (and Windows&rsquo;) own key mappings for window placement, and since I use window placements quite extensively, I have to resort to the following.</p>
<p>For sanity on my <a href="/2024/pi5">primary computer</a>, I have begun to use <a href="https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd" title="A key remapping daemon for linux">keyd</a>, which is a key remapping daemon for linux. While I could use VIA to remap keys at the hardware level, I struggle with the cognitive load of layers.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> </p>
<p>keyd takes this following setup, in which I employ the sparingly used <kbd>Caps</kbd> key as the modifier for other home row keys <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>l</kbd> to get <kbd>Home</kbd>, <kbd>PgDn</kbd>, <kbd>PgUp</kbd>, <kbd>End</kbd>. The keyd config file (<code>/etc/keyd/default.conf</code>) is as follows.</p>
<pre><code>[ids]

*

[main]

capslock = layer(nav)

[nav]

h = home
j = pagedown
k = pageup
l = end
</code></pre>
<p>In the above, <kbd>Caps</kbd> key is assigned to activate a layer called &lsquo;nav&rsquo; when held down, and keys defined in the &lsquo;nav&rsquo; layer are used in combination to get the desired input.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my wish list for a mechanical keyboard for office use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard non-compressed layout for whatever number of keys preferred</li>
<li>A <kbd>Fn</kbd> key on the LHS for use with arrow keys for navigation</li>
<li>Tactile but silent key switches</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, I want that keyboard in the middle (of the above photograph), but equipped with mechanical, hot-swappable key switches.</p>

<p>It is made worse as I work at three different places and use three different sets of input devices; and then I have multiples for use at home. Yes, this is self-inflicted. I could stick to one &mdash; buy three pieces of the same hardware to use at all locations. It is still the plan, and slowly finding my feet to overcome all possible edge cases one at a time so when I switch over, there are no regrets.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
