<p>The mail order arrived on Monday with the box containing Raspberry Pi 5 + official power adapter, the official active cooler, and a micro-HDMI adapter. Assembly was straightforward. Next up was <a href="https://github.com/ckunte/ckunte/blob/master/uses.md" title="My personalised open source software setup">software</a>. </p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi OS Desktop also comes pre-installed with Chromium browser and <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince">Evince</a> document viewer, which are both excellent. I also installed <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a> and considered installing <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been running for days now, and needs some ventilation &mdash; to prevent increase in board temperature. The portability of this Pi I can get used to. There is also <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-connect/">Connect</a> as a service, which is interesting. The backup is as simple as copying the entire volume to an external one via the <em>SD Card Copier</em>, which has no trouble doing it from M.2 SSD to an external SSD either.</p>
<p>It is refreshing to have a simple, usable interface without fluff, walled garden annoyances, with the freedom to setup, install, and have a system that is just sufficient and nothing more.</p>
<h2 id="custom-keyboard-shortcuts">Custom keyboard shortcuts</h2>
<p>There are a bunch of <a href="https://github.com/gnmearacaun/RasPiOS-labwc/blob/main/rc.xml">defaults in labwc</a>, which Raspberry Pi OS adopted late last year, and it took me a while to figure this out, and on how to add custom keyboard shortcuts for some basic things like starting an application, e.g., Chromium with, say, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>&nbsp;c&nbsp;</kbd>, and lock screen with, say, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>&nbsp;l&nbsp;</kbd>. (A couple of defaults I use the most is the window snapping to either left, right, or full screen. These can be done with <kbd>Meta</kbd><kbd>&larr;</kbd>, <kbd>Meta</kbd><kbd>&rarr;</kbd>, or <kbd>Meta</kbd><kbd>a</kbd>; where <kbd>Meta</kbd> is either <kbd>Win</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> key depending on the keyboard.) Add the keyboard section and key binds to <code>$HOME/.config/labwc/rc.xml</code> within the <code>openbox_config</code> open and close tags. (Ensure they do not clash with the defaults.) </p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;openbox_config xmlns=&quot;http://openbox.org/3.4/rc&quot;&gt;
&lt;!-- pre-populated defaults here (leave'em alone) --&gt;

&lt;keyboard&gt;

  &lt;!-- Launch Chromium --&gt;
  &lt;keybind key=&quot;C-A-c&quot;&gt;
    &lt;action name=&quot;Execute&quot; command=&quot;chromium&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/keybind&gt;

  &lt;!-- Launch File Explorer --&gt;
  &lt;keybind key=&quot;W-e&quot;&gt;
    &lt;action name=&quot;Execute&quot; command=&quot;pcmanfm&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/keybind&gt;

  &lt;!-- Lock screen --&gt;
  &lt;keybind key=&quot;C-A-l&quot;&gt;
    &lt;action name=&quot;Execute&quot; command=&quot;dm-tool lock&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/keybind&gt;

&lt;/keyboard&gt;

&lt;/openbox_config&gt;

<p><em>Update (2025-03):</em> I heard <a href="https://atp.fm/630">ATP.fm</a> complaining about the state of MacOS&rsquo;s UI in their episode this week. So I am not alone in this after all. The excess padding, the big radii of window corners, the oddities of controls, the overzealous security, along with a large portion of the little SSD locked-up for system software is all annoying! In contrast, when I fire up Pi, it feels like sanity. </p>
<p>At SCALE 2023, someone asked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a> what OS does he use today. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/kaandEt_pKw" title="Ken Thompson - Closing Keynote - SCaLE 20x">He said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have for most of my life, because I was sort of born into it, run Apple alright? Now recently, meaning within in the last five years, I have become more and more depressed, and what Apple is doing to something that should allow you to work is just atrocious but they are taking a lot of space and time to do it, so it&rsquo;s OK. And I have come, within the last month or two, to say even though I have invested, you know, zillion years in Apple, I am throwing it away, and I am going to Linux &mdash; to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_OS">Raspbian</a> in particular.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="trade-offs">Trade-offs</h2>
<p>Everything is a trade-off these days; that applies to Raspberry Pi and the OS too. Here are the things that annoy me:</p>
<ul>
<li>The non-standard 5A charger; can&rsquo;t use chargers you already own</li>
<li>The official case is not designed for active cooler + M.2 SSD HAT</li>
<li>With active-cooling + the charger, it&rsquo;s no longer inexpensive</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi OS&rsquo;s 4K scaling issues</li>
<li>Underpowered GPU. Applications that require it won&rsquo;t run well</li>
<li>Screen-saving is buggy; need exiting UI via right-click to get back</li>
<li>MS Teams (web) won&rsquo;t pick up webcam or headset attached</li>
</ul>
